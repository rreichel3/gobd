A lightweight OBD dumper written in Go

Written specifically for the ELM-327 chipset, this Go program relies on the Serial connection library from tarm. It is in its first stages, and as such may not 100% work. Sadly, my testing is currently on hold as my adapter is broken. 

Pull requests always welcome :)
